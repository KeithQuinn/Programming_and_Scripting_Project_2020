## Fishers' Iris Data Set

## *Introduction*
In 1936, the british biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher published “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”. In this paper Fisher states that “when two or more poplualtions have been measured in several characters special interest attaches to certain linear functions of the measurements by which the populations are discriminated”. This is known as linear discriminant analysis LDA. LDA is discussed in this README file in section X.


## *Anderson's IRIS Data Set*
To demonstrate LDA Fisher used data that was collected by the American botanist Edgar Anderson. The data was collected for three related species of IRIS flower; setosa, virginica and versicolor depicted in Figure 1. In total data was collected for 50 samples of each of the three species, a total of 150 samples. For each of the samples four variables were measured;
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width
