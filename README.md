# Programming_and_Scripting_Project_2020

## Problem statement 
This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set. You must research
the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An
online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have
investigated it previously.

You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are
easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. You might
do that for this project as follows:

1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:

    * outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    * saves a histogram of each variable to png files
    * outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

It might help to suppose that your manager has asked you to investigate the data
set, with a view to explaining it to your colleagues. Imagine that you are to give a
presentation on the data set in a few weeks’ time, where you explain what investigating
a data set entails and how Python can be used to do it. You have not been asked to
create a deck of presentation slides, but rather to present your code and its output to
them.

## *Introduction*
In 1936, the british biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher published “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”. In this paper Fisher states that “when two or more poplualtions have been measured in several characters special interest attaches to certain linear functions of the measurements by which the populations are discriminated”. This is known as linear discriminant analysis (LDA). LDA is discussed in this README file in section X. The ai

## *Anderson's IRIS Data Set*
To demonstrate LDA Fisher used data that was collected by the American botanist Edgar Anderson. The data was collected for three related species of IRIS flower; setosa, virginica and versicolor depicted in Figure 1. In total data was collected for 50 samples of each of the three species, a total of 150 samples. For each of the samples four variables were measured;
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width
